/**
 *  The SmartClient system supports hierarchical data (also referred to as tree data
 *   due to its "branching" organization) with:
 * 
 * 
 *  - the Tree class, which manipulates hierarchical data sets
 * 
 *  - the TreeGrid widget class, which extends the ListGrid class to visually
 *      present tree data in an expandable/collapsible format.
 * 
 *  - the ColumnTree widget class, which visually
 *      presents tree data in a so-called
 *      "Miller Column" format.
 * 
 *   For information on DataBinding Trees, see treeDataBinding.
 * 
 *   A ColumnTree shows a single branch of the underlying Tree horizontally, from
 *   left to right. Thus, the leftmost column shows all the top-level nodes. When the user clicks
 *   one of those nodes, a new column is shown immediately to the right of the top-level column,
 *   showing the selected node's children. Additional columns are shown as required to present
 *   lower-level children. The behavior of ColumnTree is similar to that of the Browser interface
 *   in the Apple&trade; iTunes&trade; application.

                                       *  - textMatchStyle is forced to "exactCase" for DataSourceField.primaryKey
                                       *   fields on update and remove operations, unless
                                       *   OperationBinding.allowMultiUpdate is in force. This means that a normal update
                                       *   or remove operation - which is constrained by a unique primaryKey value or combination, to
                                       *   affect only a single data row - will use an equality match on all primaryKey fields. This
                                       *   is desirable because it makes index usage more likely. Note that this means the key values
                                       *   "foo" and "FOO" are distinct, which is a change from previous behavior. For most databases,
                                       *   this change will have no effect because most databases do not by default allow primaryKey
                                       *   values that only differ in case anyway - if a table has a row with a PK of "foo" and you
                                       *   try to insert a row with a PK of "FOO", most databases will fail with a constraint violation.
                                       *   However, if you are using a database hat allows key values that differ only in case, and you
                                       *   need to support this for some reason, you can switch the framework back to the previous
                                       *   behavior by setting property allow.case.sensitive.pks to true in
                                       *   your server.properties file. Note, we do not recommend this; in fact, we do
                                       *   not recommend the use of text primaryKey fields at all. Where you have control ,we would
                                       *   always recommend the use of automatically incrementing numeric sequence keys.
                                       * 
                                       *  - textMatchStyle does not apply to boolean or temporal (date, datetime, time)
                                       *   DataSourceField.type. Such fields are always checked for equality. If
                                       *   you have a need for more complex matching, such as date-range checking, use AdvancedCriteria
                                       * 
                                       *  - Critiera values for temporal fields must be real dates (Javascript Date
                                       *   objects on the client, instances of java.util.Date on the server). Attempting
                                       *   to match against a string or any other type of value will result in an "always fails"
                                       *   clause being generated. This behavior is how the client code has always worked, but is a
                                       *   change for the server-side DataSources, in the interests of consistency. The previous
                                       *   behavior was:
                                       * 
                                       *  - SQLDataSource used to attempt to match the date column to the criteria value provided;
                                       *    if that value was an appropriately-formatted string, that attempt might have
                                       *    worked, but it would be database-specific. If you have an application that depends on
                                       *    this old behavior, you can switch it back on by adding the following to your
                                       *    server.properties file:
                                       *    sql.temporal.fields.require.date.criteria: false
                                       * 
                                       *  - HibernateDataSource and JPADataSource used to skip such clauses altogether, which
                                       *    results in the opposite behavior (there is an implied "always succeeds" clause, because
                                       *    the clause is not present in the query at all). If you have an application that depends on
                                       *    this old behavior, you can switch it back on by adding the following to your
                                       *    server.properties file:
                                       *    jpa.temporal.fields.require.date.criteria: false or
                                       *    hibernate.temporal.fields.require.date.criteria: false, as appropriate
                                       * 
                                       * 
                                       *  - textMatchStyle does not apply to fields used in the joins generated to satisfy
                                       *   DataSourceField.includeFrom declarations or entity relations in
                                       *   Hibernate or JPA. Again, such comparisons are always for equality
                                       * 
                                       *  - textMatchStyle is applied to numeric fields only if the supplied criteria value
                                       *   is a string. So for a numeric field "myNumber", we will match 10, 100, 110 and 1000 if a
                                       *   criteria value of "10" (the quoted string) is supplied, but we will only match 10 if a
                                       *   criteria value of 10 (the actual number) is supplied
                                       * 
                                       *  - This is a change in behavior for the server-side DataSource implementations, in the
                                       *    interests of consistency with the client behavior. Previously, all three of the built-in
                                       *    DataSource implementations applied textMatchStyle to numeric fields regardless of the
                                       *    criteria value's type. If you have an application that depends on this old behavior,
                                       *    you can switch it back on by adding the following to your server.properties
                                       *    file: sql.substring.numeric.criteria: true or
                                       *    hibernate.substring.numeric.criteria: true or
                                       *    jpa.substring.numeric.criteria: true, as appropriate
                                       * 
                                       * 
                                       *  - "exactCase" matching cannot be made consistent across all database providers because
                                       *   each database has its own idea of whether case-sensitive matching should be the default,
                                       *   and how to switch it on and off (if that is even possible)
                                       * 
                                       *  - Microsoft SQL Server must have case-sensitive matching enabled by setting a
                                       *    case-sensitive collation when the database is created (there are more fine-grained
                                       *    options, but we do not recommend them because of the scope for further inconsistency,
                                       *    where "exactCase" works correctly on table A but not on table B). See

     *  - Nothing, if DataBoundComponent.addDropValues is false
